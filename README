This is a project of mine (É™) to attempt to bring the Wicd network manager and the
aircrack-ng suite together. In particular, the WEP cracking bits of aircrack-ng. If
you have any suggestions for how I could do this better, please speak up. I am not
an expert, and welcome any assistance/advice I can get. Also feel free to submit
ideas and such that you may have but for whatever reason don't feel like implimenting
your self.

== INSTALLING ==
The easiest way to install it is to run the install script (be sure to do so as root)
then restart the Wicd client. It will copy my modified version of netentry.py to
/usr/share/wicd/gkt/netentry.py and a bash script called "wep.sh" to 
/usr/share/wicd/wep.sh. Note that the original netentry.py will be copied to
netentry.py.old in that same directory if you ever wish to restore it. Also be sure to
edit wep.sh before installing. At the very top two variables are defined: device and mac.
device needs to be set to the device that aireplay-ng and airodump-ng will use. Airmon-ng
creates it typically, and typically sets it to mon0 (but I've seen otherwise so I left it
as an option to change). mac needs to be set to that devices mac address (can be found by
running ifconfig. It will be the same as your wifi card). Then go down to the next line
that says "airmon-ng start wlan0" and change wlan0 to your actual wifi card.

You should have Wicd and the aircrack-ng suite installed before this.

== Future Plans ==
Ideas I had for the future. No particular order:
- Make it do more than just show a button (actually launch aircrack and the rest of
	the needed programs)
- Make it automatically save the cracked key when it gets it
- Option to automatically crack all networks upon scan
- Option to automatically connect upon successful crack
- Not really related to aircrack, but option to have wicd automatically connect to
	unsecured networks as soon as they are detected.
- Make the whole thing GTK based, no more terminal work.
